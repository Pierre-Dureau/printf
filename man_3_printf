.SH NAME
_printf \- formatted output conversion
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB #include "main.h"
\fB #include <stdarg.h>
\fB #include <stdlib.h>
\fB #include <unistd.h>

\fB int _printf(const char *format, ...);
.SH DESCRIPTION

.SS Definition:
The _printf function prints values on the terminal. The output produced depends on the format. _printf is a variadic function, meaning it can
take a variable number of arguments.

.SS Format:
Format is a const char* variable (which means it's a string), it must start and end by a double quote ("). The format string can have normal characters that are printed and
conversion specifiers. Conversion specifiers start with a percentage sign (%) then one or more characters.

Example : _printf("Hello everyone at %s", "Holberton School"); => The format string is "Hello everyone at %s".

.SS Variable arguments:
A comma is put after the format string and then the variable arguments must correspond in order to the conversion specifiers that are inside
the format string.

.SS Conversion specifiers:
A conversion specifiers is a combination of a percent sign and one or several characters that specify the type of the variable. The different
specifiers supported are:

c s c.
Variable arguments
%c | print a single character
%s | print a string of characters
%% | print a single percent sign (%)
%d | print a decimal (base 10) number
%i | print an integer in base 10
%b | print a number or a character as binary (0 1)
%u | print an unsigned integer (0 to 4,294,967,295)
%o | print an unsigned integer in base 8 (0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7)
%x | print an unsigned integer in base 16 (0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b c d e f)
%X | same as %x, but the letters are in uppercase (A B C D E F)
%S | same as %s, but the non-printable characters (32 < ASCII value >= 127) are replaced by "\\x" and their hexadecimal value in uppercase with 2 characters
%p | print an address
%r | print a string in reverse
%R | print a string encoded in rot13

.SH RETURN value:
If successful, _printf would return the number of characters the function printed, excluding the '\\0' indicating the end of the string.
If _printf failed, it would return the value -1.
